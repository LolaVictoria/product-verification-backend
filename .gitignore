 Missing validate_manufacturer_access Method âœ… FIXED
I added a comprehensive validate_manufacturer_access method to your AuthMiddleware class that:

Validates if a user has access to manufacturer resources
Handles admin users (who have access to all manufacturers)
Verifies manufacturer users belong to the correct manufacturer
Checks manufacturer status and verification
Returns detailed access information
I also added a require_manufacturer_access decorator that uses this method.
