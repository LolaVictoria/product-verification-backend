Create a complete email-based ownership transfer system with uniform 24-hour delay and duress pin protection:

USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
1. User registration/login with email as primary identifier
2. Two-pin system: normal pin + duress pin
3. User profile with: email, hashedNormalPin, hashedDuressPin, recoveryEmail, isVerified
4. Optional wallet address linking for advanced users

TRANSFER SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
1. Transfer initiation:
   - Current owner enters: new owner email + their pin
   - System creates pending transfer record
   - Uniform 24-hour delay for ALL transfers (no exceptions)
   - Identical UI response regardless of pin type

2. Transfer states and logic:
   - PENDING: 24-hour countdown active
   - CONFIRMED: Normal pin → transfer executes after 24 hours
   - CANCELLED: Duress pin → auto-cancelled after 24 hours
   - EXPIRED: User cancellation or timeout

DURESS PIN SECURITY:
1. Silent detection system:
   - Recognize duress pin without indicating to user
   - Log all actions as suspicious
   - Send silent alerts to security team
   - Start evidence collection process

2. Security actions during duress:
   - All transfers appear normal but flagged internally
   - Geo-location tracking
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Session recording
   - Automatic cancellation after 24 hours

EMAIL CONFIRMATION SYSTEM:
1. Transfer notifications:
   - Immediate: "Transfer initiated, processing in 24 hours"
   - 12 hours: "Transfer completing in 12 hours - cancel if unauthorized"
   - 30 minutes: "Final warning - transfer completing soon"
   - Completion: Success/failure notification

2. Cancellation system:
   - Email links to cancel transfer
   - Dashboard cancel button
   - SMS confirmation (optional)
   - Customer service override

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Pending transfer management
2. Pin validation and duress detection
3. Automated 24-hour delay system
4. Email notification service
5. Security monitoring and alerting
6. Evidence collection for law enforcement
